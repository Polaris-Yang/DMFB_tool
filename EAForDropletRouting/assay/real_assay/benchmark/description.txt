Benchmark description:

1. We assume that the coordinate of the bottom-left corner of a biochip is (0, 0).
   Moreover, all droplets are located at their sources at time step zero.

2. ARRAY: W H -> width/height of a biochip

3. TIMECONSTRAINT: timimng constraint, set to 20 for all benchmarks for fair comparison with [Su et al, DATE'06].

4. TIME: T -> max. time of droplet transportation.  Note that T is always TIMECONSTRAINT+1

5. BLOCK block_name 
   x y rx ry
   (x y): bottom-left corner, (rx+1, ry+1): up-right corner
   ex: "1 1 3 3" -> (1, 1) and (4, 4)

6. PIN pin_name
   x, y
   (x, y): the coordinate of this pin
   The last PIN is always sink while other PINs are sources

7. pin_name = W means that this droplet goes to the waste reservoir.

8. The source(s) and sink of a net do not count as the # of cells used for routing.
   See Figure 8 (c) and the experimental evaluation section of [Su et al, DATE'06] 

9. A droplet can use other droplets' source/sink for routing.

10. Once a droplet reaches its sink, it stays at there.  

11. There may be more than one droplet which needs to go to the waste resrevoir at one 2D plane.
    Currently, we assume that there exists no fluidic constraint of these two droplets near the 
    their common sink.  That is, if the waste reservoir located at cell (x, y), there is no 
    fluidic constraint if these two droplets are within the bounding box of (x-1, y-1) and 
    (x+1, y+1).  A more realistic way is that a droplet reaches its sink at time t, move to the
    reservoir at time t+1.  Therefore, at time t+2, this droplet "disappear" from chip.
